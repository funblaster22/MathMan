I wanted a way to do my math homework online but in a way that I could mark mistakes and easily return to problems that I
got wrong in order to optimize study time and reduce paper waste & backpack weight.

## Developing

Ensure you have Nodejs >= 16 installed and pnpm. This project uses Svelte, SvelteKit and Tailwind.

Once you've installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
